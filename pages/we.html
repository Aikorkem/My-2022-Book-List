                    <h2>We by Yevgeny Zamyatin</h2>
                    <p><strong>The exhilarating dystopian novel that inspired George Orwell's 1984
                        and foreshadowed the worst excesses of Soviet Russia</strong></p>
                    <p>In a glass-enclosed city of absolute straight lines, ruled over by the all-powerful 'Benefactor', the
                        citizens of the totalitarian society of OneState live out lives devoid of passion and creativity -
                        until D-503,
                        a mathematician who dreams in numbers, makes a discovery: he has an individual soul. Set in the
                        twenty-sixth
                        century AD, We is the classic dystopian novel and was the forerunner of works such as George
                        Orwell's 1984 and
                        Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. It was suppressed for many years in Russia and remains a resounding
                        cry for
                        individual freedom, yet is also a powerful, exciting and vivid work of science fiction.</p>

                    <h3>Quotes:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>‚Äú...Those two, in paradise, were given a choice: happiness without freedom, or freedom without
                            happiness. There was no third alternative...‚Äù</li>
                        <li>‚ÄúIf human foolishness had been as carefully nurtured and cultivated as intelligence has been for
                            centuries, perhaps it would have turned into something extremely precious.‚Äù</li>
                        <li>‚ÄúA man is like a novel: until the very last page you don't know how it will end. Otherwise it
                            wouldn't even be worth reading.‚Äù</li>
