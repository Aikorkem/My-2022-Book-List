                    <h2>Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery</h2>
                    <p><strong>This heartwarming story has beckoned generations 
                        of readers into the special world of Green Gables, an old-fashioned farm outside a town called Avonlea.</strong></p>
                    <p>Anne Shirley, an eleven-year-old orphan, has arrived in this verdant corner of 
                        Prince Edward Island only to discover that the Cuthberts—elderly Matthew and his 
                        stern sister, Marilla—want to adopt a boy, not a feisty redheaded girl. But before 
                        they can send her back, Anne—who simply must have more scope for her imagination and 
                        a real home—wins them over completely. A much-loved classic that explores all the vulnerability, 
                        expectations, and dreams of a child growing up, <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> is also a wonderful portrait 
                        of a time, a place, a family… and, most of all, love.</p>

                        <li>“Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think. It's splendid to find out

                        <li>“Well, I don't want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by 
                            diamonds all my life. I'm quite content to be Anne of Green Gables, with my string of pearl beads.”</li>
