                    <h2>Persepolis: The story of a Childhood by Marjane Satrapi</h2>
                    <p><strong>Wise, funny, and heartbreaking, <em>Persepolis</em> is Marjane Satrapi’s 
                        acclaimed graphic memoir of growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution.</strong></p>
                    <p>In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the coming-of-age story of her life in Tehran from ages 
                        six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah’s regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the 
                        devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the 
                        great-granddaughter of one of Iran’s last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the 
                        history of her country.</p>
                        <p><em>Persepolis</em> paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between
                         home life and public life. Marjane’s child’s-eye view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and 
                         heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own 
                         extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, Persepolis is at once a story 
                         of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, with laughter 
                         and tears, in the face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot 
                         help but fall in love.</p>
