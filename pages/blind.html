                    <h2>Blindness by José Saramago</h2>
                    <p><strong>From Nobel Prize winning author José Saramago, a magnificent, mesmerizing parable of loss</strong></p>
                    <p>A city is hit by an epidemic of "white blindness" that spares no one. Authorities confine the blind to an empty 
                        mental hospital, but there the criminal element holds everyone captive, stealing food rations, and assaulting women. 
                        There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides her charges—among them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, 
                        a dog of tears—through the barren streets, and their procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing. 
                        As Blindness reclaims the age-old story of a plague, it evokes the vivid and trembling horrors of the twentieth century, 
                        leaving readers with a powerful vision of the human spirit that's bound both by weakness and exhilarating strength.</p>
                    <h3>Quotes:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>“Perhaps only in a world of the blind will things be what they truly are.”</li>
                        <li>“If I'm sincere today, what does it matter if I regret it tomorrow?”</li>
                        <li>“If we cannot live entirely like human beings, at least let us do everything 
                            in our power not to live entirely like animals.”</li>
                    </ul>
